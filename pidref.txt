Drone reacts slowly and hovers bad or unstable (eg dances, wobbles)
Increase P-value and decrease D value. Maybe decrease I value. The P value must in no case be higher than the above-determined threshold.

During hover the drone drifts
Increase the I term and possibly P-value.

Oscillation during fast flights
I-value too high or too low - depending on the drone.

Drone oscillates slightly with disturbances (eg nudge or gust of wind)
D value down

Drone reacts too slowly to disturbances (eg nudge or gust of wind)
Increase D-value and possibly P-value.
